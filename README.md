Goal: create gmt's with larger amount of info for different taxa
- Used BIOcyc smart tables that are included as csv's for E.coli, H. Sapiens (humans), M. musculus (mice), and P. putida
- For the smart tables I have metabolic pathways (Pathways), Common name, Kegg ids, genes, and then enzymes of pathway
-I then ran the following code in the Markdown-> addition-> to get the gmt for the taxa
